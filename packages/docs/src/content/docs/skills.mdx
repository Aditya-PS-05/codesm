Skills are specialized instruction sets that enhance codesm for specific tasks.

---

## What are Skills?

Skills provide:
- Domain-specific instructions and best practices
- Specialized workflows
- Pre-configured tool usage
- Performance optimization guidelines

Think of skills as "expert modes" for different types of work.

---

## skills.sh Integration

codesm integrates with [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) - the skill registry by Vercel Labs.

### Browse Available Skills

```bash frame="none"
# The agent can browse the registry
skill browse
```

Available skills from `vercel-labs/agent-skills`:
- **react-best-practices** - React/Next.js optimization (57 rules)
- **web-design-guidelines** - UI/UX best practices
- **claude.ai** - Claude-specific optimizations

### Fetch a Skill

```bash frame="none"
# Fetch by name from skills.sh
skill fetch react-best-practices

# Fetch from custom GitHub repo
skill fetch --source owner/repo/path
```

### Auto-Suggest Skills

The agent automatically suggests skills based on context:

```bash frame="none"
# Suggest based on files being edited
skill suggest files=["src/App.tsx", "components/Button.tsx"]
```

**Triggers:**
- `.tsx/.jsx` files → react-best-practices
- `.css/.scss` files → web-design-guidelines
- Mentions of "react", "next" → react-best-practices

## Local Skills

### Project Skills

Create skills in your project:

```
project/
├── .codesm/
│   └── skills/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── skills/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### Global Skills

Add to your config directory:

```
~/.codesm/skills/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/SKILL.md
```

---

## SKILL.md Format

Skills follow the [skills.sh format](https://skills.sh):

```markdown title="SKILL.md"
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
triggers:
  - "*.tsx"
  - "react"
---

# My Skill Instructions

When working on this type of code:

1. Follow these patterns
2. Use these best practices
3. Avoid these anti-patterns

## Examples

\`\`\`tsx
// Good pattern
export function Component() { ... }
\`\`\`
```

### Frontmatter Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique identifier |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `triggers` | File patterns or keywords that trigger loading |

---

## Using Skills

### In Prompts

Just describe what you're working on - the agent auto-fetches relevant skills:

```txt frame="none"
Help me optimize this React component
```

The agent will automatically fetch `react-best-practices` from skills.sh.

### Manual Loading

```bash frame="none"
# Load a local skill
skill load my-skill

# Show active skills
skill active

# Unload a skill
skill unload my-skill
```

---

## Skill Tool Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `suggest` | Auto-suggest skills based on file context |
| `browse` | List skills from skills.sh registry |
| `fetch` | Fetch skill by name or custom source |
| `list` | Show local project skills |
| `load` | Load a local skill |
| `unload` | Unload a skill from context |
| `active` | Show currently loaded skills |
| `show` | Display skill content without loading |

---

## Creating Custom Skills

1. Create `SKILL.md` in `.codesm/skills/` or `skills/`
2. Add frontmatter with name and description
3. Write instructions in Markdown
4. The agent will discover and use it automatically

### Example: Debugging Skill

```markdown title=".codesm/skills/SKILL.md"
---
name: debugging
description: Systematic debugging approach
triggers:
  - "bug"
  - "error"
  - "fix"
---

# Debugging Workflow

1. **Reproduce** - Confirm the issue exists
2. **Isolate** - Find the minimal reproduction
3. **Investigate** - Use logs, breakpoints, traces
4. **Fix** - Make the smallest change that fixes it
5. **Verify** - Confirm fix doesn't break other things
6. **Document** - Add test to prevent regression
```

## Skill Caching

Fetched skills are cached at `~/.cache/codesm/skills/` for fast re-use.
