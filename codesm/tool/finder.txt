High-speed codebase search and retrieval using Gemini Flash.

The finder tool combines traditional code search (grep/glob) with LLM intelligence
to provide fast, accurate results. It:

1. Extracts keywords from natural language queries
2. Runs parallel grep/glob searches
3. Uses Gemini Flash to filter, rank, and summarize results

Parameters:
- query: What you're looking for (natural language)
- path: Directory to search (optional, defaults to project root)
- file_pattern: File glob pattern like "*.py" (optional)

Example:
```json
{
    "query": "authentication middleware",
    "path": "src/",
    "file_pattern": "*.py"
}
```

Best for:
- Finding code by meaning, not just keywords
- Quick codebase exploration
- Locating specific functionality

For semantic/embedding-based search, use `codesearch` instead.
