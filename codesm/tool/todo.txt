Use this tool to:
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, trackable items
- Track what's pending, in progress, or completed
- Prioritize work items

## Actions

- `add`: Create a new todo with content and optional priority
- `list`: Show all todos (use include_done=true to see completed)
- `start`: Mark a todo as in-progress
- `done`: Mark a todo as completed
- `cancel`: Mark a todo as cancelled
- `delete`: Remove a todo entirely
- `update`: Change a todo's content
- `clear_done`: Remove all completed todos

## Examples

Add a high-priority task:
{"action": "add", "content": "Fix authentication bug", "priority": 2}

List pending tasks:
{"action": "list"}

Mark task as in progress:
{"action": "start", "id": "todo_abc123"}

Complete a task:
{"action": "done", "id": "todo_abc123"}
