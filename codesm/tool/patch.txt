Apply a patch to modify multiple files in a single operation.

Supports adding, updating, deleting, and moving files with context-aware changes.

## Patch Format

The patch must use the following format:

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: path/to/new/file.py
+line 1 of new file
+line 2 of new file

*** Delete File: path/to/delete.py

*** Update File: path/to/existing/file.py
@@ context description (optional)
 unchanged line (context)
-removed line
+added line
 unchanged line (context)

*** Update File: old/path.py
*** Move to: new/path.py
@@ function definition
 def example():
-    old_code()
+    new_code()

*** End Patch
```

## Line Prefixes

- `+` - Line to add
- `-` - Line to remove  
- ` ` (space) - Context line (must match existing content)

## When to Use

- Making changes across multiple files atomically
- Applying complex refactoring operations
- When you need context-aware matching (not exact string match)
- Moving/renaming files with content changes

## Important

- Context lines MUST match existing file content exactly
- Use enough context lines to uniquely identify the location
- File paths are relative to the workspace root
